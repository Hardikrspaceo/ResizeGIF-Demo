# ResizeGIF-Demo




In this demo, I’m going to make a demo on how to upload a GIF image file without losing the animation on PHP website.

And here, in order to help you, I’ve written an article on [Resize GIF image PHP tutorial](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/crop-resize-animated-gif-without-losing-animation-php-website/) to help you implement it in your PHP website.

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your PHP website and looking to [hire PHP developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-php-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
